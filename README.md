# Web Starter Kit with Bootstrap

## Overview

This is a Bootstrap version of [Web Starter Kit](http://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit). Having spent some time with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), I decided to stick with it, but liked Addy Osmani's gulp configuration. So I quickly swapped Google's app with Bootstrap and made minor changes to gulp file. Turned out to be a decent starting point for webapp development.

## Quickstart

Clone this repository and build on what we include in the `app` directory.

## Tooling

If you would like to use the optional tooling we provide, make sure your system has [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/), [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install) installed.

### Node

Let's check to see if you already have Node installed. Bring up a terminal and type `node --version`. If Node responds, and if it shows a version at or above v0.10.x, proceed to checking if you have Ruby installed too. If you require Node, go to [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/) and click on the big green Install button.

### Ruby

Bring up a terminal and type `ruby --version`. If Ruby responds, and if it shows a version number at or above 1.8.7 then type `gem --version`. If you don't see any errors, proceed to installing the Sass gem. If you require Ruby, it can be installed from the [Ruby downloads](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) page.

### Sass

Bring up a terminal and type `sass --version`. If Sass is installed it should return a version number at or above 3.3.x. If you don't see any errors, proceed to the Gulp installation. If you need to install Sass, see the command-line instructions on the [Sass installation](http://sass-lang.com/install) page.

### Gulp

Bring up a terminal and type `gulp --version`. If Gulp is installed it should return a version number at or above 3.5.x. If you don't see any errors, proceed to the Gulp commands section. If you need to install Gulp, open up a terminal and type in the following:

```sh
$ npm install --global gulp
```

This will install Gulp globally. Depending on your user account, you may need to gain elevated permissions using `sudo` (i.e `sudo npm install --global gulp`). Next, install the local dependencies Web Starter Kit requires:

```sh
$ npm install
```

That's it! You should now have everything needed to use the Gulp tools in Web Starter Kit.

### Gulp Commands

You can now use Gulp with the following commands to stay productive during development:

#### Watch For Changes & Automatically Refresh Across Devices

```sh
$ gulp serve
```

This outputs an IP address you can use to locally test and another that can be used on devices connected to your network.

### Build & Optimize

```sh
$ gulp
```

Build and optimize the current project, ready for deployment. This includes linting as well as image, script, stylesheet and HTML optimization and minification.

#### Performance Insights

```sh
$ gulp pagespeed
```

Runs the deployed (public) version of your site against the [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) API to help you stay on top of where you can improve.
